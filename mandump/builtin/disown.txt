disown: disown [-h] [-ar] [jobspec ... | pid ...]
    Remove jobs from current shell.
    
    Removes each JOBSPEC argument from the table of active jobs.  Without
    any JOBSPECs, the shell uses its notion of the current job.
    
    Options:
      -a	remove all jobs if JOBSPEC is not supplied
      -h	mark each JOBSPEC so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the
    		shell receives a SIGHUP
      -r	remove only running jobs
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option or JOBSPEC is given.
