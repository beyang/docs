MPSTAT(1)                                                Linux User's Manual                                               MPSTAT(1)

NAME
       mpstat - Report processors related statistics.

SYNOPSIS
       mpstat  [  -A ] [ -n ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -I { keyword [,...] | ALL } ] [ -N { node_list | ALL } ] [ -o JSON ] [ -P { cpu_list |
       ON | ALL } ] [ interval [ count ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The mpstat command writes to standard output activities for each available  processor,  processor  0  being  the  first  one.
       Global  average  activities  among  all  processors  are  also  reported.   The mpstat command can be used both on SMP and UP
       machines, but in the latter, only global average activities will be printed. If no  activity  has  been  selected,  then  the
       default report is the CPU utilization report.

       The  interval  parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
       indicates that processors statistics are to be reported for the time since system startup (boot).  The count parameter can be
       specified in conjunction with the interval parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of count determines the number
       of reports generated at interval seconds apart. If the interval parameter is  specified  without  the  count  parameter,  the
       mpstat command generates reports continuously.

OPTIONS
       -A     This option is equivalent to specifying -n -u -I ALL -N ALL -P ALL

       -I { keyword [,...] | ALL }
              Report interrupts statistics.

              Possible keywords are CPU, SCPU, and SUM.

              With  the  CPU  keyword,  the number of each individual interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs is displayed.
              Interrupts are those listed in /proc/interrupts file.

              With the SCPU keyword, the number of each individual software interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs is dis‐
              played.  This  option works only with kernels 2.6.31 and later. Software interrupts are those listed in /proc/softirqs
              file.

              With the SUM keyword, the mpstat command reports the total number of interrupts per processor.  The  following  values
              are displayed:

              CPU
                     Processor number. The keyword all indicates that statistics are calculated as averages among all processors.

              intr/s
                     Show the total number of interrupts received per second by the CPU or CPUs.

              The  ALL  keyword  is  equivalent to specifying all the keywords above and therefore all the interrupts statistics are
              displayed.

       -N { node_list | ALL }
              Indicate the NUMA nodes for which statistics are to be reported.  node_list is a list  of  comma-separated  values  or
              range  of values (e.g., 0,2,4-7,12-).  Note that node all is the global average among all nodes. The ALL keyword indi‐
              cates that statistics are to be reported for all nodes.

       -n     Report summary CPU statistics based on NUMA node placement. The following values are displayed:

              NODE
                     Node number. The keyword all indicates that statistics are calculated as averages among all nodes.

              All the other fields are the same as those displayed with option -u (see below).

       -o JSON
              Display the statistics in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) format.  JSON output field order  is  undefined,  and  new
              fields may be added in the future.

       -P { cpu_list | ON | ALL }
              Indicate  the  processors  for  which  statistics are to be reported.  cpu_list is a list of comma-separated values or
              range of values (e.g., 0,2,4-7,12-).  Note that processor 0 is the first processor, and processor all  is  the  global
              average among all processors.  The ON keyword indicates that statistics are to be reported for every online processor,
              whereas the ALL keyword indicates that statistics are to be reported for all processors.

       -u     Report CPU utilization. The following values are displayed:

              CPU
                     Processor number. The keyword all indicates that statistics are calculated as averages among all processors.

              %usr
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application).

              %nice
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.

              %sys
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level  (kernel).  Note  that
                     this does not include time spent servicing hardware and software interrupts.

              %iowait
                     Show  the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
                     request.

              %irq
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service hardware interrupts.

              %soft
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service software interrupts.

              %steal
                     Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was  ser‐
                     vicing another virtual processor.

              %guest
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor.

              %gnice
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a niced guest.

              %idle
                     Show  the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O
                     request.

              Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any activity at all is a disabled (offline) processor.

       -V     Print version number then exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The mpstat command takes into account the following environment variable:

       S_COLORS
              When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the terminal.  Possible values for this variable are  never,
              always or auto (the latter is the default).

              Please  note  that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value is not indicative of any
              kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different ranges of values.

       S_COLORS_SGR
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal.  Its value  is  a  colon-separated
              list of capabilities that defaults to H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:Z=34;22.  Supported capabilities are:

              H=     SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 75%.

              I=     SGR substring for CPU number.

              M=     SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50% to 75%.

              N=     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              Z=     SGR substring for zero values.

       S_TIME_FORMAT
              If  this  variable  exists  and its value is ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the
              report header.  The mpstat command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp will also be com‐
              pliant with ISO 8601 format.

EXAMPLES
       mpstat 2 5
              Display five reports of global statistics among all processors at two second intervals.

       mpstat -P ALL 2 5
              Display five reports of statistics for all processors at two second intervals.

BUGS
       /proc filesystem must be mounted for the mpstat command to work.

       Only a few activities are given by the Linux kernel for each processor.

FILES
       /proc contains various files with system statistics.
