       all within one window.

               Specify a filename to save the screenshot to (overwrites any profile-related setting).

               Supported image formats: You can save to any popular image format (e.g. jpeg, png, gif, bmp). Additionally it is
               possible to save to pdf, ps or svg.

               Please note: There are several wildcards available, like

                %Y = year
                %m = month
                %d = day
                %T = time
                $w = width
                $h = height
                $name = multi-purpose (e.g. window title)
                $nb_name = like $name but without blanks in resulting strings
                $profile = name of current profile
                $R = random char (e.g. $RRRR = ag4r)
                %NN = counter

               The string is interpretted by strftime. See "man strftime" for more examples.

               As an example: shutter -f -e -o './%y-%m-%d_$w_$h.png' would create a file named '11-10-28_1280_800.png' in the
               current directory.
