bg: bg [job_spec ...]
    Move jobs to the background.
    
    Place the jobs identified by each JOB_SPEC in the background, as if they
    had been started with `&'.  If JOB_SPEC is not present, the shell's notion
    of the current job is used.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless job control is not enabled or an error occurs.
