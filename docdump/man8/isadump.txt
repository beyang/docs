ISADUMP(8)                 System Manager's Manual                 ISADUMP(8)

NAME
       isadump - examine ISA registers

SYNOPSIS
       isadump  [-y]  [-W|-L] [-k V1,V2...]  addrreg datareg [bank [bankreg]]
       #for I2C-like access
       isadump -f [-y] [-W|-L] address [range  [bank  [bankreg]]]  #for  flat
       address space

DESCRIPTION
       isadump is a small helper program to examine registers visible through
       the ISA bus. It is intended to probe any chip that lives  on  the  ISA
       bus  working  with  an  address register and a data register (I2C-like
       access) or a flat range (of up to 256 bytes).

OPTIONS
       -f     Enable flat address space mode.

       -y     Disable interactive mode. By default, isadump will wait  for  a
              confirmation  from  the  user  before messing with the ISA bus.
              When this flag is used, it will perform the operation directly.
              This is mainly meant to be used in scripts.

       -k V1,V2...
              Specify  a  comma-separated  list  of  bytes to send as the key
              sequence to enter the chip configuration mode.  Most  Super-I/O
              chips  need this.  Known key sequences are: 0x87,0x01,0x55,0x55
              for ITE, 0x55 for SMSC, 0x87,0x87 for  Winbond  and  VIA,  none
              needed for National Semiconductor.

       -W     Perform 16-bit reads.

       -L     Perform 32-bit reads.

OPTIONS (I2C-like access mode)
       At least two options must be provided to isadump. addrreg contains the
       ISA address of the address register for the  chip  to  probe;  datareg
       contains the address of the data register. Both addresses are integers
       between 0x0000 and 0x3FFF. Usually, if  the  chip's  base  address  is
       0x0nn0,  the address register is at 0x0nn5 and the data register is at
       0x0nn6. The most common base address for hardware monitoring chips  is
       0x0290.

       For  Super-I/O  chips, address register is typically at 0x2E with data
       register at 0x2F.

       The bank and bankreg parameters are useful on  the  Winbond  chips  as
       well  as on Super-I/O chips.  bank is an integer between 0 and 31, and
       bankreg is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF (default value:  0x4E  for
       Winbond  chips,  0x07  for Super-I/O chips). The W83781D datasheet has
       more information on bank selection.

OPTIONS (flat address space mode)
       In flat mode, only one parameter is mandatory.  address  contains  the
       ISA  address of the chip to probe; it is an integer between 0x0000 and
       0xFFFF.  If provided, range is how many bytes should be read (must  be
       a  multiple  of  16).  If the range isn't provided, it defaults to 256
       bytes and the address is forcibly aligned on a 256-byte boundary.

       The bank and bankreg parameters are useful on the National Semiconduc‐
       tor PC87365 and PC87366 Super-I/O chips.  bank is an integer between 0
       and 31, and bankreg is an  integer  between  0x00  and  0xFF  (default
       value:  0x09;  must  fit  in  the  specified  range).  See the PC87365
       datasheet for more information on bank selection.

NOTES
       If no bank is specified, no bank change operation is performed.

       If a bank is specified, the original value is restored before  isadump
       exits.

       Dumping  Super-I/O  chips  is typically a two-step process. First, you
       will have to access the main Super-I/O address using a  command  like:
       isadump  0x2e  0x2f  0x09.  This will select logical device 9 (correct
       value depend on the chip). At 0x60 you will find  the  logical  device
       address  word,  for example "ec c0".  Then you can use a command like:
       isadump -f 0xecc0 16.  This will dump the  logical  device  registers.
       The correct range depends on the chip.

WARNING
       Poking around in ISA data space is extremely dangerous.  Running isad‐
       ump with random parameters can cause system crashes,  data  loss,  and
       worse!  Be extremely careful when using this program.
