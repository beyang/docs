NAME
       tlp - apply laptop power saving settings

SYNOPSIS
       tlp command [parameters] [-- <config> ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Apply power saving settings manually and control ThinkPad battery features.

COMMANDS
       start  Initialize  tlp and apply power saving settings according to the actual power source. Also use to apply a changed con‐
              figuration.

       bat    Apply power saving settings for battery power source.

       true   Same as bat.

       ac     Apply power saving settings for AC power source.

       false  Same as ac.

       usb    Enable autosuspend for all USB devices, except blacklisted ones.

       bayoff Turn off optical drive in UltraBay/MediaBay.  The drive may be re-enabled by pulling the eject lever  or  pushing  the
              media eject button on newer models.

       setcharge [START_CHARGE STOP_CHARGE] [BAT0|BAT1] (ThinkPads only)
              Set  charge  thresholds  of  main  (BAT0)  or auxiliary (BAT1) battery temporarily.  Values must be between 1 and 100,
              START_CHARGE must not exceed STOP_CHARGE - 4.  Configured thresholds are  restored  upon  next  system  boot-up.  When
              called without arguments, configured thresholds are set.

       fullcharge [BAT0|BAT1] (ThinkPads only)
              Set  charge  thresholds  of main (BAT0) or auxiliary (BAT1) battery to factory presets (96/100) temporarily (causing a
              full charge).  Configured thresholds are restored upon next system boot-up.

       chargeonce [BAT0|BAT1] (ThinkPads only)
              Charge main (BAT0) or auxiliary (BAT1) battery to the stop charge threshold once (bypassing start threshold).  Config‐
              ured thresholds are restored upon next system boot-up.

       discharge [BAT0|BAT1] (ThinkPads only)
              Force complete discharge of main (BAT0) or auxiliary (BAT1) battery.

       recalibrate [BAT0|BAT1] (ThinkPads only)
              Battery recalibration: completely discharge main (BAT0) or auxiliary (BAT1) battery and recharge to 100%.

       diskid Show disk ids for configuration.

       -- PARAM=value ...
              Add parameters to temporarily overwrite the system configuration (for this program invocation only).

NOTES
       For ThinkPads with more than one battery the selection works as follows:

              BAT0 - Main or internal battery

              BAT1 - Ultrabay, Slice or replaceable battery

EXAMPLES
       Apply thresholds of 70 / 90% to the main battery:

              tlp setcharge 70 90 BAT0

       Charge the auxiliary battery to full capacity:

              tlp fullcharge BAT1

       Recalibrate the main battery:

              tlp recalibrate BAT0

FILES
       /etc/tlp.conf
              System-wide  user  configuration  file, uncomment parameters here to override default settings and customization files
              below.

       /etc/tlp.d/*.conf
              System-wide drop-in customization files, overriding defaults below.

       /usr/share/tlp/defaults.conf
              Intrinsic default settings. DO NOT EDIT this file, instead use one of the above alternatives.

       /run/tlp/run.conf
              Effective settings consolidated from all above files. DO NOT CHANGE this file, it is for reference only  and  regener‐
              ated on every invocation of TLP.

       /etc/default/tlp
              Obsolete  system-wide  configuration  file. DO NOT USE this file, it is evaluated only when /etc/tlp.conf is non-exis‐
              tent.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
