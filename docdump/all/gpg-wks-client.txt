GPG-WKS-CLIENT(1)               User Commands               GPG-WKS-CLIENT(1)

NAME
       gpg-wks-client - Client for the Web Key Service

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-wks-client [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       gpg-wks-client  is  a  simple command line client for the Web Key Ser‐
       vice.  The executable is usually located in /usr/lib/gnupg.  It allows
       a  user  to  create a publication request and to respond to a received
       confirmation request.  Communication with the Web Key Service is  done
       via email.  It also can lookup the fingerprint of a USER-ID in the Web
       Key Directory.

COMMANDS
       --supported USER-ID
              Check whether provider of the given USER-ID  supports  the  Web
              Key  Service  protocol, i.e. whether it has a Web Key Directory
              providing a submission address.

              Similar to:

                   gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr 'WKD_GET --submission-address -- USER-ID' /bye

       --check USER-ID
              Check whether a key is available, and whether the listed key is
              valid for the requested USER-ID.  You might want to use

                   gpg -v --auto-key-locate=clear,wkd,nodefault --locate-key USER-ID

              instead.

       --create FINGERPRINT USER-ID
              Create  a  publication  request for the USER-ID in the key with
              the given FINGERPRINT.  List all possible keys  (including  the
              fingerprint) for a USER-ID with:

                   gpg --list-key USER-ID

              By  default  the publication request will be printed to STDOUT.
              You can also write it to a file using the  --output  option  or
              send it using sendmail with the --send option.

       --receive
              Receive  a  MIME  confirmation request on STDIN and acknowledge
              it.

              By default the confirmation response will be printed to STDOUT.
              You  can  also  write it to a file using the --output option or
              send it using sendmail with the --send option.

       --read Receive  a  plain  text  confirmation   request.   Similar   to
              --receive, but takes only the message body on STDIN.

       --version
              Show program version and some meta information.

       -h, --help
              Output a short usage information.

       --warranty
              Print warranty information.

       --dump-options
              Dump all available options and commands.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output.

       -q, --quiet
              Be somewhat more quiet.

       --send Send the mail using sendmail.

       -o, --output FILE
              Write the mail to FILE.

       --status-fd FD
              Write status info to this FD.

       --debug
              Set   debugging   flags.   All flags are or-ed and flags may be
              given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042) or as a comma separated list of
              flag  names.   To  get a list of all supported flags the single
              word "help" can be used.

       --gpg GPG
              Use the specified command instead of gpg.

       --fake-submission-addr MAILADDR
              Send mail to MAILADDR instead of the submission address queried
              through Web Key Service.

EXAMPLES
   Send a publication request
       First  find  the  fingerprint (a long string of hex digits) of the key
       you want to publish:

           gpg --list-key "Alice <alice@example.com>"

       Now create and send the publication request:

           /usr/lib/gnupg/gpg-wks-client --create --send 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567 "Alice <alice@example.com>"

       Instead  of  "Alice  <alice@example.com>"  you  can  also  just   give
       alice@example.com.

   Confirm a confirmation request
       Paste  the  full  mail  containing the confirmation request (including
       headers) you got from the Web Key Service on STDIN after starting:

           /usr/lib/gnupg/gpg-wks-client --receive --send
