NAME
       zsoelim - satisfy .so requests in roff input

SYNOPSIS
       zsoelim [-CVh] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       zsoelim  parses file arguments, or if none are specified, its standard
       input for lines of the form:

       .so <filename>

       These requests are replaced by the contents of the filename specified.
       If  the  request  cannot  be met, zsoelim looks for filename.ext where
       .ext can be one of .gz, .Z or .z.  Other extension types may  be  sup‐
       ported depending upon compile time options.  If the request can be met
       by a compressed file, this file is decompressed using  an  appropriate
       decompressor and its output is used to satisfy the request.

       Traditionally,  soelim  programs were used to allow roff preprocessors
       to be able to preprocess the files referred to by the requests.   This
       particular  version was written to circumvent problems created by sup‐
       port for compressed manual pages.

OPTIONS
       -C, --compatible
              This flag is available for compatibility with other soelim pro‐
              grams.  Its use is to enable .so requests followed by something
              other than whitespace.  As this is already the  default  behav‐
              iour, it is ignored.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.
