compopt: compopt [-o|+o option] [-DE] [name ...]
    Modify or display completion options.
    
    Modify the completion options for each NAME, or, if no NAMEs are supplied,
    the completion currently being executed.  If no OPTIONs are given, print
    the completion options for each NAME or the current completion specification.
    
    Options:
    	-o option	Set completion option OPTION for each NAME
    	-D		Change options for the "default" command completion
    	-E		Change options for the "empty" command completion
    
    Using `+o' instead of `-o' turns off the specified option.
    
    Arguments:
    
    Each NAME refers to a command for which a completion specification must
    have previously been defined using the `complete' builtin.  If no NAMEs
    are supplied, compopt must be called by a function currently generating
    completions, and the options for that currently-executing completion
    generator are modified.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is supplied or NAME does not
    have a completion specification defined.
