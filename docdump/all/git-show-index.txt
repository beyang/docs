GIT-SHOW-INDEX(1)                 Git Manual                GIT-SHOW-INDEX(1)

NAME
       git-show-index - Show packed archive index

SYNOPSIS
       git show-index

DESCRIPTION
       Read the .idx file for a Git packfile (created with git-pack-
       objects(1) or git-index-pack(1)) from the standard input, and dump its
       contents. The output consists of one object per line, with each line
       containing two or three space-separated columns:

       ·   the first column is the offset in bytes of the object within the
           corresponding packfile

       ·   the second column is the object id of the object

       ·   if the index version is 2 or higher, the third column contains the
           CRC32 of the object data

       The objects are output in the order in which they are found in the
       index file, which should be (in a correctly constructed file) sorted
       by object id.

       Note that you can get more information on a packfile by calling git-
       verify-pack(1). However, as this command considers only the index file
       itself, it’s both faster and more flexible.
