NAME
       docker-network-rm - Remove one or more networks

SYNOPSIS
       docker network rm NETWORK [NETWORK...]

DESCRIPTION
       Removes one or more networks by name or identifier. To remove a
       network, you must first disconnect any containers connected to it.  To
       remove the network named 'my-network':

                $ docker network rm my-network

       To delete multiple networks in a single docker network rm command,
       provide multiple network names or ids. The following example deletes a
       network with id 3695c422697f and a network named my-network:

                $ docker network rm 3695c422697f my-network

       When you specify multiple networks, the command attempts to delete
       each in turn.  If the deletion of one network fails, the command
       continues to the next on the list and tries to delete that. The
       command reports success or failure for each deletion.

OPTIONS
