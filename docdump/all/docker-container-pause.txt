NAME
       docker-container-pause - Pause all processes within one or more
       containers

SYNOPSIS
       docker container pause CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]

DESCRIPTION
       The docker container pause command suspends all processes in the
       specified containers.  On Linux, this uses the freezer cgroup.
       Traditionally, when suspending a process the SIGSTOP signal is used,
       which is observable by the process being suspended.  With the freezer
       cgroup the process is unaware, and unable to capture, that it is being
       suspended, and subsequently resumed. On Windows, only Hyper-V
       containers can be paused.

       See the freezer cgroup documentation
       ⟨https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/freezer-
       subsystem.txt⟩ for further details.

       docker-container-unpause(1) to unpause all processes within a
       container.
