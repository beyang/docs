NAME
       git-multi-pack-index - Write and verify multi-pack-indexes

SYNOPSIS
       git multi-pack-index [--object-dir=<dir>] [--[no-]progress] <subcommand>

DESCRIPTION
       Write or verify a multi-pack-index (MIDX) file.

OPTIONS
       --object-dir=<dir>
           Use given directory for the location of Git objects. We check
           <dir>/packs/multi-pack-index for the current MIDX file, and
           <dir>/packs for the pack-files to index.

       --[no-]progress
           Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified, progress
           is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal.

       The following subcommands are available:

       write
           Write a new MIDX file.

       verify
           Verify the contents of the MIDX file.

       expire
           Delete the pack-files that are tracked by the MIDX file, but have
           no objects referenced by the MIDX. Rewrite the MIDX file afterward
           to remove all references to these pack-files.

       repack
           Create a new pack-file containing objects in small pack-files
           referenced by the multi-pack-index. If the size given by the
           --batch-size=<size> argument is zero, then create a pack
           containing all objects referenced by the multi-pack-index. For a
           non-zero batch size, Select the pack-files by examining packs from
           oldest-to-newest, computing the "expected size" by counting the
           number of objects in the pack referenced by the multi-pack-index,
           then divide by the total number of objects in the pack and
           multiply by the pack size. We select packs with expected size
           below the batch size until the set of packs have total expected
           size at least the batch size. If the total size does not reach the
           batch size, then do nothing. If a new pack- file is created,
           rewrite the multi-pack-index to reference the new pack-file. A
           later run of git multi-pack-index expire will delete the
           pack-files that were part of this batch.

EXAMPLES
       ·   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in the current .git folder.

               $ git multi-pack-index write

       ·   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in an alternate object store.

               $ git multi-pack-index --object-dir <alt> write

       ·   Verify the MIDX file for the packfiles in the current .git folder.

               $ git multi-pack-index verify
