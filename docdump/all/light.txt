NAME
     light — a program to control backlight controllers

SYNOPSIS
     light [OPTIONS] [VALUE]

DESCRIPTION
     light is a program to control backlight display and keyboard controllers
     under GNU/Linux.

     ·   Operates independently of X (X-Window)
     ·   Can automatically figure out the best controller to use, making full
         use of the underlying hardware
     ·   Supports a minimum cap on the brightness value, as some controllers
         set the display to be pitch black at a vaĺue of 0 (or higher)

COMMANDS
     The following unique commands are supported:

     -H, -h  Show help text and exit

     -V      Show program version and exit

     -L      List available devices

     -A      Increase brightness by value

     -U      Decrease brightness by value

     -S      Set brightness to value

     -G      Get brightness, default

     -N      Set minimum brightness to value

     -P      Get minimum brightness

     -I      Save current brightness

     -O      Restore previously saved brightness

OPTIONS
     The behavior of the above commands can be modified using these options:

     -r      Interpret input and output values in raw mode

     -s PATH
             Specify device target path.  Use -L to list available devices

     -v LEVEL
             Set verbosity level, by default light only outputs read values:

             0:  Read values
             1:  Read values, Errors
             2:  Read values, Errors, Warnings
             3:  Read values, Errors, Warnings, Notices

FILES
     When run in its classic SUID root mode light caches settings and current
     brightness in /etc/light.  In its non-privileged mode of operation the
     ~/.cache/light directory is used instead.
