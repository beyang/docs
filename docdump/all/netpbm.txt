NAME
       netpbm - package of graphics manipulation programs and libraries

DESCRIPTION
       Netpbm is a package of graphics programs and programming libraries.

       There  are  over  220  separate programs in the package, most of which
       have "pbm", "pgm", "ppm", or "pnm" in their names.  For example,  pnm‐
       scale and giftopnm.

       For example, you might use pnmscale to shrink an image by 10%.  Or use
       pnmcomp to overlay one image on top of another.   Or  use  pbmtext  to
       create  an  image of text.  Or reduce the number of colors in an image
       with pnmquant.

The Netpbm Formats
       All of the programs work with a set of  graphics  formats  called  the
       "netpbm"  formats.   Specifically,  these  formats are pbm(5), pgm(5),
       ppm(5), and pam(5).  The first three  of  these  are  sometimes  known
       generically as pnm.  Many of the Netpbm programs convert from a Netpbm
       format to another format or vice versa.  This is so you  can  use  the
       Netpbm  programs to work on graphics of any format.  It is also common
       to use a combination of Netpbm programs to convert from one non-Netpbm
       format  to  another non-Netpbm format.  Netpbm has converters for over
       80 graphics formats, and as a package Netpbm lets you do more graphics
       format conversions than any other computer graphics facility.

       The Netpbm formats are all raster formats, i.e. they describe an image
       as a matrix of rows and columns of pixels.  In  the  PBM  format,  the
       pixels  are  black and white.  In the PGM format, pixels are shades of
       gray.  In the PPM format, the pixels are in full color.  The PAM  for‐
       mat  is  more sophisticated.  A replacement for all three of the other
       formats, it can represent matrices of general data including  but  not
       limited to black and white, grayscale, and color images.

       Programs  designed  to work with PBM images have "pbm" in their names.
       Programs designed to work with PGM, PPM, and PAM images similarly have
       "pgm", "ppm", and "pam" in their names.

       All  Netpbm  programs designed to read PGM images see PBM images as if
       they were PGM too.  All Netpbm programs designed to  read  PPM  images
       see  PGM and PBM images as if they were PPM.  See the section "Implied
       Format Conversion" below.

       Programs that have "pnm" in their names read PBM,  PGM,  and  PPM  but
       unlike  "ppm"  programs, they distinguish between them and their func‐
       tion depends on the format.  For example, pnmtogif creates a black and
       white  GIF  output  image  if its input is PBM or PGM, but a color GIF
       output image if its input is PPM.  And  pnmscale  produces  an  output
       image  of the same format as the input.  A ppmscale program would read
       all three PNM input formats, but would see them all as PPM  and  would
       always generate PPM output.

       If  it  seems  wasteful  to you to have three separate PNM formats, be
       aware that there is a historical reason for  it.   In  the  beginning,
       there  were  only  PBMs.   PGMs came later, and then PPMs.  Much later
       came PAM, which realizes the possibility of having just one  aggregate
       format.

       The formats are described in the man pages pbm(5), pgm(5), ppm(5), and
       pam(5),

Implied Format Conversion
       A program that uses the PGM library to read an image can  read  a  PBM
       image as well as a PGM image.  The program sees the PBM image as if it
       were the equivalent PGM image, with a maxval of 255.

       A program that uses the PPM library to read an image can  read  a  PGM
       image  as  well as a PPM image and a PBM image as well as a PGM image.
       The program sees the PBM or PGM image as if it were the equivalent PPM
       image, with a maxval of 255 in the PBM case and the same maxval as the
       PGM in the PGM case.

Netpbm and Transparency
       In many graphics format, there's a means of  indicating  that  certain
       parts  of  the image are wholly or partially transparent, meaning that
       if it were displayed "over" another image, the other image would  show
       through  there.   Netpbm  formats  deliberately  omit that capability,
       since their purpose is to be extremely simple.

       In Netpbm, you handle transparency via a transparency mask in a  sepa‐
       rate  (slightly  redefined) PGM image.  In this pseudo-PGM, what would
       normally be a pixel's intensity is instead  it  an  opaqueness  value.
       See pgm(5).  pnmcomp is an example of a program that uses a PGM trans‐
       parency mask.

The Netpbm Programs
       The Netpbm programs are generally useful run by a person from  a  com‐
       mand  shell,  but  are also designed to be used by programs.  A common
       characteristic of Netpbm programs is that they are simple, fundamental
       building  blocks.   They  are most powerful when stacked in pipelines.
       Netpbm programs do not use graphical user interfaces (in fact, none of
       them  display  graphics at all, except for a very simple Linux Svgalib
       displayer) and do not seek input from a user.

       Each of these programs has its own man page.

Common Options
       There are a few options that are present  on  all  programs  that  are
       based  on  the  Netpbm  libraries, including virtually all Netpbm pro‐
       grams.  These are not mentioned in the individual man  pages  for  the
       programs.

       -quiet Suppress  all  informational  messages  that would otherwise be
              issued to Standard Error.  (To be precise, this only  works  to
              the  extent  that the program in question implements the Netpbm
              convention  of  issuing  all  informational  messages  via  the
              pm_message() service of the Netpbm libraries).

       -version
              Instead  of  doing  anything  else,  report  the version of the
              libpbm library linked with the program (it may have been linked
              statically  into  the  program,  or  dynamically  linked at run
              time).  Normally, the Netpbm programs  and  the  libraries  are
              installed  at  the  same time, so this tells you the version of
              the program and all the other Netpbm  libraries  and  files  it
              uses as well.

              Here  is  a directory of the Netpbm programs.  You can also use
              man -k to search for a program that does what you want.

The Netpbm Libraries
       The Netpbm programming libraries, libpbm(3), libpgm(3), libppm(3), and
       libpnm(3), make it easy to  write  programs  that  manipulate  graphic
       images.   Their main function is to read and write files in the Netpbm
       format, and because the Netpbm package contains converters for all the
       popular  graphics formats, if your program reads and writes the Netpbm
       formats, you can use it with any formats.

       But the libraries also contain some utility functions, such as charac‐
       ter drawing and RGB/YCrCb conversion.

       The libraries have the conventional C linkage.  Virtually all programs
       in the Netpbm package are based on the Netpbm libraries.

   Application Notes
       As a collection of primitive tools, the power of Netpbm is  multiplied
       by the power of all the other unix tools you can use with them.  These
       notes remind you of some of the more useful ways to do  this.   Often,
       when people want to add high level functions to the Netpbm tools, they
       have overlooked some existing tool that, in combination  with  Netpbm,
       already does it.

       Often,  you  need to apply some conversion or edit to a whole bunch of
       files.

       As a rule, Netpbm programs take one input file and produce one  output
       file,  usually on Standard Output.  This is for flexibility, since you
       so often have to pipeline many tools together.

       Here is an example of a shell command to convert all your of PNG files
       (named *.png) to JPEG files named *.jpg:

       for  i  in  *.png; do pngtopnm $i | ppmtojpeg >`basename $i .png`.jpg;
       done

       Or you might just generate a stream of individual shell commands,  one
       per file, with awk or perl.  Here's how to brighten 30 YUV images that
       make up one second of a movie, keeping the images in the same files:

       ls *.yuv .br | perl -ne 'chomp;
       print yuvtoppm $_ | ppmbrighten -v 100 | ppmtoyuv >tmp$$.yuv; ,
       mv tmp$$.yuv $_0
       ' .br | sh

       The tools find (with the -exec option) and xargs are also  useful  for
       simple manipulation of groups of files.

       Some  shells'  "process  substitution"  facility can help where a non-
       Netpbm program expects you to identify a disk file for input  and  you
       want  it  to  use  the result of a Netpbm manipulation.  Say printcmyk
       takes the filename of a Tiff CMYK file as input and what you have is a
       PNG file abc.png.  Try:

       printcmyk <({ pngtopnm abc.png | pnmtotiffcmyk ; })

       It  works in the other direction too, if you have a program that makes
       you name its output file and you want  the  output  to  go  through  a
       Netpbm tool.

   Other Graphics Software
       Netpbm contains primitive building blocks.  It certainly is not a com‐
       plete graphics library.

       The first thing you will need to make use of any of these tools  is  a
       viewer.    For  the  X  inclined,  there  is  xzgv.   See  ftp://meta‐
       lab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X.

       xloadimage and its extension xli are also common  ways  to  display  a
       graphic image in X.

       ImageMagick  is  like  a visual version of Netpbm.  Using the X/Window
       system on Unix, you can do basic editing of images and lots of  format
       conversions.  The package does include at least some non-visual tools.
       Convert, Mogrify, Montage, and Animate are popular programs  from  the
       ImageMagick  package.   ImageMagick runs on Unix, Windows, Windows NT,
       Macintosh, and VMS.

       The Gimp is a visual image editor for Unix and X, in the same category
       as the more famous, less capable, and much more expensive Adobe Photo‐
       shop, etc. for Windows.  See http://www.gimp.org.

       The file program looks at a file and tells you what kind  of  file  it
       is.   It  recognizes  most  of  the graphics formats with which Netpbm
       deals, so it is pretty handy for  graphics  work.   Netpbm's  anytopnm
       program depends on file.  See ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file.

       The  Utah  Raster  Toolkit serves a lot of the same purpose as Netpbm,
       but without the emphasis on format conversions.  This package is based
       on  the  RLE format, which you can convert to and from the Netpbm for‐
       mats.  http://www.cs.utah.edu/research/projects/alpha1/urt.html  gives
       some  information  on the Utah Raster Toolkit, but does not tell where
       to get it.

       There are some Netpbm-like graphics tools distributed by the Army High
       Performance  Computing  Research Center at http://www.arc.umn.edu/gvl-
       software/media-tools.html.  These operate directly on non-Netpbm  for‐
       mat  images,  so they aren't included in the Netpbm package.  However,
       you can use them with any image format by using the Netpbm format con‐
       verters.

       Ivtools  is  a suite of free X Windows drawing editors for Postscript,
       Tex, and web graphics production, as well as an embeddable and extend‐
       able  vector  graphic  shell.   It  uses  the  Netpbm facilities.  See
       http://www.ivtools.org.

       Ilib is a C subroutine library with functions for adding  text  to  an
       image (as you might do at a higher level with pbmtext, pnmcomp, etc.).
       It   works   with   Netpbm   input   and   output.    Find    it    at
       http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/Ilib.   Netpbm  also includes character
       drawing functions in the libppm library, but they do not have as fancy
       font  capabilities  (see  ppmlabel for an example of use of the Netpbm
       character drawing functions).

       GD is a library of graphics routines that is part of PHP.   It  has  a
       subset  of Netpbm's functions and has been found to resize images more
       slowly and with less quality.

       pnm2ppa converts to HP's "Winprinter" format (for HP  710,  720,  820,
       1000,  etc).   It  is  a  superset  of  Netpbm's pbmtoppa and handles,
       notably, color.  However, it is  more  of  a  printer  driver  than  a
       Netpbm-style  primitive  graphics  building block.  See http://source‐
       forge.net/project/?group_id=1322.

       The program morph morphs one image into another.  It uses Targa format
       images,  but  you can use tgatoppm and ppmtotga to deal with that for‐
       mat.  You have to use the graphical (X/Tk) Xmorph to create  the  mesh
       files  that you must feed to morph.  morph is part of the Xmorph pack‐
       age.   See   http://www.colorado-research.com/~gourlay/software/Graph‐
       ics/Xmorph.

       To  create an animated GIF, or extract a frame from one, use gifsicle.
       gifsicle converts between animated GIF and still GIF, and you can  use
       ppmtogif  and giftopnm to connect up to all the Netpbm utilities.  See
       http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle.

       To convert an image of text to text (optical character  recongition  -
       OCR),  use  gocr  (think  of  it  as  an  inverse  of  pbmtext).   See
       http://altmark.nat.uni-magdeburg.de/~jschulen/ocr/.

       http://schaik.com/pngsuite contains a PNG test suite -- a whole  bunch
       of PNG images exploiting the various features of the PNG format.

       Another       version       of       pnmtopng/pngtopnm      is      at
       http://www.schaik.com/png/pnmtopng.html.  The version  in  Netpbm  was
       actually  based on that package a long time ago, and you can expect to
       find better exploitation of the PNG format, especially recent enhance‐
       ments,  in  that package.  It may be a little less consistent with the
       Netpbm project and less exploitive of recent  Netpbm  format  enhance‐
       ments, though.

       jpegtran  Does  some  of  the same transformations as Netpbm is famous
       for, but does them specifically on JPEG files and  does  them  without
       loss  of  information.   By  contrast,  if you were to use Netpbm, you
       would first decompress the JPEG image to Netpbm format, then transform
       the  image,  then compress it back to JPEG format.  In that recompres‐
       sion, you lose a little image information because JPEG is a lossy com‐
       pression.    jpegtran   comes   with   the  Independent  Jpeg  Group's
       (http://www.ijg.org) JPEG library.

       Some tools to deal with EXIF files (see also  Netpbm's  jpegtopnm  and
       pnmtojpeg):   To   dump   (interpret)   an   EXIF   header:   Exifdump
       ((http://topo.math.u-psud.fr/~bousch/exifdump.py)       or       Jhead
       (http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead).

       A Python EXIF library and dumper:  http://pyexif.sourceforge.net.

       Latex2html  converts  Latex  document  source to HTML document source.
       Part of that involves graphics, and Latex2html uses Netpbm  tools  for
       some  of that.  But Latex2html through its history has had some rather
       esoteric codependencies with Netpbm.  Older  Latex2html  doesn't  work
       with current Netpbm.  Latex2html-99.2beta8 works, though.

   Other Graphics Formats
       People  never  seem  to  tire of inventing new graphics formats, often
       completely redundant with pre-existing ones.  Netpbm  cannot  keep  up
       with  them.  Here is a list of a few that we know Netpbm does not han‐
       dle (yet).

         CGM+

         Windows Meta File (.WMF).  Libwmf converts from WMF to  things  like
       Latex, PDF, PNG.  Some of these can be input to Netpbm.

         Microsoft  Word,  RTF.   Microsoft keeps a proprietary hold on these
       formats.  Any software you see that can handle them is likely to  cost
       money.

HISTORY
       Netpbm has a long history, starting with Jef Poskanzer's Pbmplus pack‐
       age in 1988.  The file HISTORY in the Netpbm source  code  contains  a
       historical overview as well as a detailed history release by release.

AUTHOR
       Netpbm  is  based  on the Pbmplus package by Jef Poskanzer, first dis‐
       tributed in 1988 and maintained by him until 1991.   But  the  package
       contains  work  by countless other authors, added since Jef's original
       work.  In fact, the name is derived from the fact that  the  work  was
       contributed  by  people all over the world via the Internet, when such
       collaboration was still novel enough to merit naming the package after
       it.

       Bryan  Henderson  has been maintaining Netpbm since 1999.  In addition
       to packaging work by others, Bryan  has  also  written  a  significant
       amount of new material for the package.
