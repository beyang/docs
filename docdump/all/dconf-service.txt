DCONF-SERVICE(1)                User Commands                DCONF-SERVICE(1)

NAME
       dconf-service - D-Bus service for writes to the dconf database

SYNOPSIS
       dconf-service

DESCRIPTION
       The dconf-service program provides the ca.desrt.dconf name on the
       session or system bus. Users or administrators should never need to
       start the service, as it will be automatically started by dbus-
       daemon(1) whenever an application tries to write settings.

       Reading values from the dconf database does not involve the service;
       it is only needed for writes. The service is stateless and can exit
       freely at any time (and is therefore robust against crashes).
