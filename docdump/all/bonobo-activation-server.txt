NAME
       bonobo-activation-server - GNOME component tracker

DESCRIPTION
       This  application  tracks  information  about installed components and
       brokers components, in conjunction with its client library; libbonobo-
       activation.

       It     reads     the     component     descriptions     from    ${pre‐
       fix}/lib/bonobo/servers/*.server.  These files provide an XML descrip‐
       tion of a components capabilities which can be queried and manipulated
       by clients from the client library.

       Bonobo-activation-server also ensures that the minimum neccessary num‐
       ber of servers for your display setup are running.

       Bonobo-activation-server  executes all components with the environment
       inherited from the first process to start the server. In  addition  to
       using  your prefix, it will examine the BONOBO_ACTIVATION_PATH and the
       GNOME2_PATH environment variables to find .server files.

       In  addition  it  examines  an  XML  configuration  file   in   ${pre‐
       fix}/etc/bonobo-activation/bonobo-activation-config.xml
