NAME
       gvfsd-fuse - Fuse daemon for gvfs

SYNOPSIS
       gvfsd-fuse PATH

DESCRIPTION
       gvfsd-fuse maintains a fuse mount to make gvfs backends available to
       POSIX applications. The mount point for the fuse filesystem is
       provided by the [PATH] argument.

       gvfsd-fuse is normally started by gvfsd(1). In this case, the mount
       point is $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gvfs or $HOME/.gvfs.

       -o OPTION
           Set a fuse-specific option. See the fuse documentation for a list
           of these.
