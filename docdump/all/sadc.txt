NAME
       sadc - System activity data collector.

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/sysstat/sadc [ -C comment ] [ -D ] [ -F ] [ -L ] [ -V ] [ -S { DISK | INT | IPV6 | POWER | SNMP | XDISK | ALL | XALL
       [,...] } ] [ interval [ count ] ] [ outfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       The sadc command samples system data a specified number of times (count) at a specified interval measured in seconds  (inter‐
       val).  It  writes in binary format to the specified outfile or to standard output. If outfile is set to -, then sadc uses the
       standard system activity daily data file (see below).  In this case, if the file already exists, sadc will overwrite it if it
       is  from a previous month.  By default sadc collects most of the data available from the kernel.  But there are also optional
       metrics, for which the relevant options must be explicitly passed to sadc to be collected (see option -S below).

       The standard system activity daily data file is named saDD unless option -D is used, in which case its  name  is  saYYYYMMDD,
       where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the current day.  By default it is located in the
       /var/log/sysstat directory. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location for it: If outfile is a directory (instead of
       a plain file) then it will be considered as the directory where the standard system activity daily data file will be saved.

       When  the  count parameter is not specified, sadc writes its data endlessly.  When both interval and count are not specified,
       and option -C is not used, a dummy record, which is used at system startup to mark the time when the counter restarts from 0,
       will be written.  For example, one of the system startup script may write the restart mark to the daily data file by the com‐
       mand entry:

       /usr/lib/sysstat/sadc -

       The sadc command is intended to be used as a backend to the sar command.

       Note: The sadc command only reports on local activities.

OPTIONS
       -C comment
              When neither the interval nor the count parameters are specified, this option tells sadc to write a dummy record  con‐
              taining the specified comment string.  This comment can then be displayed with option -C of sar.

       -D     Use saYYYYMMDD instead of saDD as the standard system activity daily data file name.

       -F     The  creation  of  outfile will be forced. If the file already exists and has a format unknown to sadc then it will be
              truncated. This may be useful for daily data files created by an older version of sadc and whose format is  no  longer
              compatible with current one.

       -L     sadc  will  try to get an exclusive lock on the outfile before writing to it or truncating it. Failure to get the lock
              is fatal, except in the case of trying to write a normal (i.e. not a dummy and not a header)  record  to  an  existing
              file,  in  which case sadc will try again at the next interval. Usually, the only reason a lock would fail would be if
              another sadc process were also writing to the file. This can happen when cron is used to launch sadc.  If  the  system
              is  under  heavy  load, an old sadc might still be running when cron starts a new one. Without locking, this situation
              can result in a corrupted system activity file.

       -S { DISK | INT | IPV6 | POWER | SNMP | XDISK | ALL | XALL [,...] }
              Specify which optional activities should be collected by sadc.  Some activities are optional  to  prevent  data  files
              from  growing too large.  The DISK keyword indicates that sadc should collect data for block devices.  The INT keyword
              indicates that sadc should collect data for system interrupts.  The IPV6 keyword indicates that IPv6 statistics should
              be  collected  by  sadc.   The POWER keyword indicates that sadc should collect power management statistics.  The SNMP
              keyword indicates that SNMP statistics should be collected by sadc.  The ALL keyword is equivalent to  specifying  all
              the keywords above and therefore all previous activities are collected.

              The  XDISK  keyword is an extension to the DISK one and indicates that partitions and filesystems statistics should be
              collected by sadc in addition to disk statistics. This option works only with kernels 2.6.25 and later.  The XALL key‐
              word  is  equivalent  to  specifying  all the keywords above (including keyword extensions) and therefore all possible
              activities are collected.

              Important note: The activities (including optional ones) saved in an existing data file prevail  over  those  selected
              with option -S.  As a consequence, appending data to an existing data file will result in option -S being ignored.

       -V     Print version number then exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The sadc command takes into account the following environment variable:

       S_TIME_DEF_TIME
              If  this  variable  exists and its value is UTC then sadc will save its data in UTC time.  sadc will also use UTC time
              instead of local time to determine the current daily data file located in the /var/log/sysstat directory.

EXAMPLES
       /usr/lib/sysstat/sadc 1 10 /tmp/datafile
              Write 10 records of one second intervals to the /tmp/datafile binary file.

       /usr/lib/sysstat/sadc -C Backup_Start /tmp/datafile
              Insert the comment Backup_Start into the file /tmp/datafile.

BUGS
       The /proc filesystem must be mounted for the sadc command to work.

       All the statistics are not necessarily available, depending on the kernel version used.  sadc assumes that you are  using  at
       least a 2.6 kernel.

FILES
       /var/log/sysstat/saDD
       /var/log/sysstat/saYYYYMMDD
              The  standard  system  activity daily data files and their default location.  YYYY stands for the current year, MM for
              the current month and DD for the current day.

       /proc and /sys contain various files with system statistics.
