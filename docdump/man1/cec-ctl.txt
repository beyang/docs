NAME
       cec-ctl - An application to control cec devices

SYNOPSIS
       cec-ctl [-h] [-d <dev>] [many other options]

DESCRIPTION
       The cec-ctl tool is used to control cec devices. It is able to control
       almost any aspect of such devices covering the full CEC API.

OPTIONS
       -d, --device=<dev>
              Use device <dev> as the CEC device. If <dev> is a number,  then
              /dev/cec<dev> is used.

       -v, --verbose
              Turn on verbose reporting.

       -h, --help
              Prints the help message.

       -p, --phys-addr=<addr>
              Use  this physical address. The address can be a number (e.g. 0
              or 0x11b1) or formatted as a.b.c.d where each  component  is  a
              hex value from 0-f (e.g. 0.0.0.0 or 1.1.b.1).

       -o, --osd-name=<name>
              Use this OSD name. The maximum length is 14 characters.

       -V, --vendor-id=<id>
              Use  this  vendor  ID.  The  vendor  ID is a number from 0x0 to
              0xffffff.

       -C, --clear
              Clear all logical addresses, leaving the CEC  device  unconfig‐
              ured.

       -n, --no-reply
              By default when sending a CEC message that expects a reply this
              utility will wait for that reply. With this option it will just
              send it without waiting for the reply.

       -t, --to=<la>
              Send the message to the given logical address (0-15).

       -f, --from=<la>
              Send  message from the given logical address. It is only neces‐
              sary to use this  option  if  multiple  logical  addresses  are
              claimed.  By default the first assigned logical address will be
              used.

       -r, --show-raw
              Show the raw CEC message in hex.

       -s, --skip-info
              Skip the Driver Info output section.

       -S, --show-topology
              Show the CEC topology, detecting which other CEC devices are on
              the CEC bus.

       -P, --poll
              Send a poll message.

       -T, --trace
              Trace all called ioctls. Useful for debugging.

       -w, --wall-clock
              Show timestamps as wall-clock time.

       --cec-version-1.4
              Use CEC Version 1.4 instead of 2.0 (the default).

       --allow-unreg-fallback
              Allow  fallback  to  Unregistered  if all logical addresses are
              claimed.  By default the adapter will remain unconfigured.

       --no-rc-passthrough
              Disable the RC passthrough. By default remote control CEC  mes‐
              sages    are    passed    on    as    input   keystrokes   (the
              CEC_LOG_ADDRS_FL_ALLOW_RC_PASSTHRU flag is set when calling the
              CEC_ADAP_S_LOG_ADDRS  ioctl),  but this can be blocked by using
              this option.

       --reply-to-followers
              The reply will be sent to followers as  well.  By  default  the
              reply  will only go to the follower that initiated the CEC mes‐
              sage. But if you have other followers running as well, then  by
              giving this option they will also receive the reply.

       --timeout=<ms>
              Set the reply timeout in milliseconds (default is 1000 ms).

       --list-ui-commands
              List  all  UI  commands  that  can  be  used with option --con‐
              trol-pressed.

       --tv   Configure the CEC adapter as a TV.

       --record
              Configure the CEC adapter as a recording and playback device.

       --tuner
              Configure the CEC adapter as a tuner device.

       --playback
              Configure the CEC adapter as a playback device.

       --audio

       --processor
              Configure the CEC adapter as a processor device.

       --switch
              Configure the CEC adapter as a pure CEC switch.

       --cdc-only
              Configure the CEC adapter as a CDC-only device.

       --unregistered
              Configure  the  CEC  adapter   as   an   unregistered   device.

              Signal that the RC source has a Dev Setup Menu.

       --rc-src-contents
              Signal that the RC source has a Contents Menu.

       --rc-src-media-context
              Signal that the RC source has a Media Context Menu.

       -m, --monitor
              Start  monitoring CEC traffic. This will monitor broadcast mes‐
              sages, messages directed  to  this  CEC  adapter  and  messages
              transmitted  by  this  CEC  adapter.  Directed messages between
              other CEC devices are not monitored. This option requires root.

       -M, --monitor-all
              Start monitoring all CEC traffic. This  will  monitor  all  CEC
              messages,   including   directed  messages  between  other  CEC
              devices. This option requires root.  Not all CEC  devices  sup‐
              port this monitoring mode. It will fallback to regular monitor‐
              ing mode if it is not supported.

       --monitor-pin
              Start monitoring and analyzing the low-level  CEC  pin  transi‐
              tions. This is only possible if the device has the CEC_CAP_MON‐
              ITOR_PIN capability. This option requires root.   When  in  pin
              monitoring mode all 0->1 and 1->0 CEC pin transitions are moni‐
              tored and analysed. This is effectively a cheap  CEC  bus  ana‐
              lyzer.

       --monitor-time=<secs>
              Monitor for the given number of seconds, then exit. The default
              (0) is to monitor forever.

       --ignore=<la>,<opcode>
              Ignore messages from logical address <la> and  opcode  <opcode>
              when  monitoring.   "all"  can  be used for <la> or <opcode> to
              match all logical addresses or opcodes.  To  ignore  poll  mes‐
              sages use "poll" as <opcode>.

       --store-pin=<to>
              Store  the  CEC  pin events to the given file. This can be read
              and analyzed later via the --analyze-pin option. Use - to write
              to stdout instead of to a file.

       --analyze-pin=<from>
              Read  and analyze the CEC pin events from the given file. Use -
              to read from stdin instead of from a file.
