NAME
       cdiff - a wrapper tool for colordiff

SYNOPSIS
       cdiff {URL|FILE}

DESCRIPTION
       cdiff is a wrapper for colordiff and will add colour to a diff given in a URL or a file, e.g.

           cdiff http://some.url.com/foo/thing.patch

       It also adds support for reading gzip, bzip2, xz, and lzma compressed diffs, and like colordiff, also supports reading diffs
       from standard input if URL or a filename is not specified.  cdiff pipes colordiff's output through less -R.

SEE ALSO
       cdiff is part of the colordiff package, which should be consulted for further reference.
