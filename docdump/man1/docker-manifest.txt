NAME
       docker-manifest - Manage Docker image manifests and manifest lists

SYNOPSIS
       docker manifest COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       The docker manifest command has subcommands for managing image
       manifests and manifest lists. A manifest list allows you to use one
       name to refer to the same image built for multiple architectures.

       To see help for a subcommand, use:

              docker manifest CMD --help

       For full details on using docker manifest lists, see the registry v2
       specification.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help[=false]
           help for manifest
