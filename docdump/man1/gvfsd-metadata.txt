GVFSD-METADATA(1)               User Commands               GVFSD-METADATA(1)

NAME
       gvfsd-metadata - Metadata daemon for gvfs

SYNOPSIS
       gvfs-metadata [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       gvfsd-metadata is a daemon acting as a write serialiser to the
       internal gvfs metadata storage. It is autostarted by GIO clients when
       they make metadata changes. Read operations are done by client-side
       GIO code directly, and don't require the daemon to be running.

       The gvfs metadata capabilities are used by the nautilus file manager,
       for example.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Prints a short help text and exits.

       --version
           Shows the version number and exits.

       -r, --replace
           Replace the currently running instance.

EXIT STATUS
       On success 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

FILES
       $XDG_DATA_HOME/gvfs-metadata
           The directory where the gvfs metadata database files are stored
