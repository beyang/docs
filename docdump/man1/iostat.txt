IOSTAT(1)                    Linux User's Manual                    IOSTAT(1)

NAME
       iostat   -   Report  Central  Processing  Unit  (CPU)  statistics  and
       input/output statistics for devices and partitions.

SYNOPSIS
       iostat [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -N ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [ -V ]  [
       -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ] [ -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } ] [ -o JSON
       ] [ [ -H ] -g group_name ] [ --human ] [ -p [ device [,...] | ALL ]  ]
       [ device [...] | ALL ] [ interval [ count ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  iostat  command is used for monitoring system input/output device
       loading by observing the time the devices are active  in  relation  to
       their  average  transfer  rates.  The iostat command generates reports
       that can be used to change system configuration to better balance  the
       input/output load between physical disks.

       The  first  report generated by the iostat command provides statistics
       concerning the time since the system was booted, unless the -y  option
       is used (in this case, this first report is omitted).  Each subsequent
       report covers the time since the previous report. All  statistics  are
       reported each time the iostat command is run. The report consists of a
       CPU header row followed by a row of CPU statistics. On  multiprocessor
       systems,  CPU  statistics are calculated system-wide as averages among
       all processors. A device header row is displayed followed by a line of
       statistics for each device that is configured.

       The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between
       each report. The count parameter can be specified in conjunction  with
       the interval parameter. If the count parameter is specified, the value
       of count determines the number of reports generated at  interval  sec‐
       onds  apart.  If the interval parameter is specified without the count
       parameter, the iostat command generates reports continuously.

REPORTS
       The iostat command generates two types of reports, the CPU Utilization
       report and the Device Utilization report.

       CPU Utilization Report
              The  first  report  generated  by the iostat command is the CPU
              Utilization Report. For multiprocessor systems, the CPU  values
              are  global  averages among all processors.  The report has the
              following format:

              %user
                     Show the percentage of  CPU  utilization  that  occurred
                     while executing at the user level (application).

              %nice
                     Show  the  percentage  of  CPU utilization that occurred
                     while executing at the user level with nice priority.

              %system
                     Show the percentage of  CPU  utilization  that  occurred
                     while executing at the system level (kernel).

              %iowait
                     Show  the  percentage  of time that the CPU or CPUs were
                     idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
                     request.

              %steal
                     Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by
                     the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servic‐
                     ing another virtual processor.

              %idle
                     Show  the  percentage  of time that the CPU or CPUs were
                     idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O
                     request.

       Device Utilization Report
              The second report generated by the iostat command is the Device
              Utilization Report. The device report provides statistics on  a
              per  physical device or partition basis. Block devices and par‐
              titions for which statistics are to be displayed may be entered
              on  the  command  line.  If no device nor partition is entered,
              then statistics are displayed for every device used by the sys‐
              tem, and providing that the kernel maintains statistics for it.
              If the ALL keyword is given on the command line,  then  statis‐
              tics  are  displayed  for  every  device defined by the system,
              including those that have never been used.  Transfer rates  are
              shown  in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment variable
              POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.
              The  report  may  show  the  following fields, depending on the
              flags used:

              Device:
                     This column gives the  device  (or  partition)  name  as
                     listed in the /dev directory.

              tps
                     Indicate  the  number  of transfers per second that were
                     issued to the device. A transfer is an  I/O  request  to
                     the  device.  Multiple  logical requests can be combined
                     into a single I/O request to the device. A  transfer  is
                     of indeterminate size.

              Blk_read/s (kB_read/s, MB_read/s)
                     Indicate  the  amount  of  data  read  from  the  device
                     expressed in a number of blocks  (kilobytes,  megabytes)
                     per  second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors and there‐
                     fore have a size of 512 bytes.

              Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s, MB_wrtn/s)
                     Indicate the  amount  of  data  written  to  the  device
                     expressed  in  a number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)
                     per second.

              Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) read.

              Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)  writ‐
                     ten.

              r/s
                     The number (after merges) of read requests completed per
                     second for the device.

              w/s
                     The number (after merges) of  write  requests  completed
                     per second for the device.

              sec/s (kB/s, MB/s)
                     The  number  of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) read from
                     or written to the device per second.

              rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes)  read  from
                     the device per second.

              wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s)
                     The  number of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to
                     the device per second.

              rqm/s
                     The number of I/O requests merged per second  that  were
                     queued to the device.

              rrqm/s
                     The  number of read requests merged per second that were
                     queued to the device.

                     queued to the device.

              %rrqm
                     The  percentage  of read requests merged together before
                     being sent to the device.

              %wrqm
                     The percentage of write requests merged together  before
                     being sent to the device.

                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the I/O requests that
                     were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions,  this  field  was  known  as
                     avgrq-sz and was expressed in sectors.

              rareq-sz
                     The  average  size  (in  kilobytes) of the read requests
                     that were issued to the device.

              wareq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of  the  write  requests

              await
                     The  average  time  (in  milliseconds)  for I/O requests
                     issued to the device to be  served.  This  includes  the
                     time  spent  by the requests in queue and the time spent
                     servicing them.

              r_await
                     The average time (in  milliseconds)  for  read  requests
                     issued  to  the  device  to be served. This includes the
                     time spent by the requests in queue and the  time  spent
                     servicing them.

              w_await
                     The  average  time  (in milliseconds) for write requests
                     issued to the device to be  served.  This  includes  the
                     time  spent  by the requests in queue and the time spent
                     servicing them.

              aqu-sz
                     The average queue  length  of  the  requests  that  were
                     issued to the device.
                     Note:  In  previous  versions,  this  field was known as
                     avgqu-sz.

              svctm
                     The average  service  time  (in  milliseconds)  for  I/O
                     requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do not
                     trust this field any more.  This field will  be  removed
                     in a future sysstat version.

              %util
                     Percentage  of  elapsed  time  during which I/O requests
                     were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the
                     device).  Device  saturation  occurs  when this value is
                     close to 100% for  devices  serving  requests  serially.
                     But  for  devices  serving requests in parallel, such as
                     RAID arrays  and  modern  SSDs,  this  number  does  not
                     reflect their performance limits.

OPTIONS
       -c     Display the CPU utilization report.

       -d     Display the device utilization report.

       -g group_name { device [...] | ALL }
              Display  statistics for a group of devices.  The iostat command
              reports statistics for each individual device in the list  then
              a  line  of  global  statistics  for  the  group  displayed  as
              group_name and made up of all the devices in the list. The  ALL
              keyword  means that all the block devices defined by the system
              shall be included in the group.

       -H     This option must be used with option -g and indicates that only
              global  statistics  for  the group are to be displayed, and not
              statistics for individual devices in the group.

       -h     Make the Device Utilization Report easier to read by  a  human.
              --human is enabled implicitly with this option.

       --human
              Print  sizes  in  human  readable format (e.g. 1k, 1.23M, etc.)
              The units  displayed  with  this  option  supersede  any  other
              default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...) associated with the
              metrics.

       -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } [ device [...] | ALL ]
              Display persistent device names. Options ID, LABEL, etc.  spec‐
              ify the type of the persistent name. These options are not lim‐
              ited, only prerequisite is that directory with required persis‐
              tent  names  is  present  in  /dev/disk.   Optionally, multiple
              devices can be specified in the chosen  persistent  name  type.
              Because persistent device names are usually long, option

       -k     Display statistics in kilobytes per second.

       -m     Display statistics in megabytes per second.

       -N     Display  the registered device mapper names for any device map‐
              per devices.  Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.

       -o JSON
              Display the statistics in  JSON  (Javascript  Object  Notation)
              format.   JSON  output field order is undefined, and new fields
              may be added in the future.

       -p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ]
              The -p option displays statistics for  block  devices  and  all
              their partitions that are used by the system.  If a device name
              is entered on the command line, then statistics for it and  all
              its  partitions  are displayed. Last, the ALL keyword indicates
              that statistics have to be displayed for all the block  devices
              and partitions defined by the system, including those that have
              never been used. If option -j is defined  before  this  option,
              devices  entered  on the command line can be specified with the
              chosen persistent name type.

       -s     Display a short (narrow) version of the report that should  fit
              in 80 characters wide screens.

       -t     Print  the time for each report displayed. The timestamp format
              may depend on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment  vari‐
              able (see below).

       -V     Print version number then exit.

       -x     Display extended statistics.

       -y     Omit  first  report  with statistics since system boot, if dis‐
              playing multiple records at given interval.

       -z     Tell iostat to omit output for any devices for which there  was
              no activity during the sample period.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  iostat command takes into account the following environment vari‐
       ables:

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              When this variable is set, transfer rates are shown in 512-byte
              blocks instead of the default 1K blocks.

       S_COLORS
              When  this  variable is set, display statistics in color on the
              terminal.  Possible values for this variable are never,  always
              or auto (the latter is the default).

              Please  note  that  the color (being red, yellow, or some other
              color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind of
              issue  simply because of the color. It only indicates different
              ranges of values.

       S_COLORS_SGR
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statis‐
              tics  on  the terminal.  Its value is a colon-separated list of
              capabilities            that            defaults             to
              H=31;1:I=32;22:M=35;1:N=34;1:Z=34;22.   Supported  capabilities
              are:

              H=     SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for  percentage
                     values greater than or equal to 75%.

              I=     SGR substring for device names.

              M=     SGR  substring  for  percentage values in the range from
                     50% to 75%.

              N=     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              Z=     SGR substring for zero values.

       S_TIME_FORMAT
              If this variable exists and its value is ISO then  the  current
              locale  will  be  ignored  when printing the date in the report
              header. The  iostat  command  will  use  the  ISO  8601  format
              (YYYY-MM-DD)  instead.   The timestamp displayed with option -t
              will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.

EXAMPLES
       iostat
              Display a single history since boot  report  for  all  CPU  and
              Devices.

       iostat -d 2
              Display a continuous device report at two second intervals.

       iostat -d 2 6
              Display six reports at two second intervals for all devices.

       iostat -x sda sdb 2 6
              Display six reports of extended statistics at two second inter‐
              vals for devices sda and sdb.

       iostat -p sda 2 6
              Display six reports at two second intervals for device sda  and
              all its partitions (sda1, etc.)

BUGS
       /proc filesystem must be mounted for iostat to work.

       Kernels older than 2.6.x are no longer supported.

       The  average  service  time (svctm field) value is meaningless, as I/O
       statistics are now calculated at block level, and we don't  know  when
       the  disk  driver  starts  to process a request. For this reason, this
       field will be removed in a future sysstat version.

FILES
       /proc/stat contains system statistics.

       /proc/uptime contains system uptime.

       /proc/diskstats contains disks statistics.

       /sys contains statistics for block devices.

       /proc/self/mountstats contains statistics for network filesystems.

       /dev/disk contains persistent device names.
