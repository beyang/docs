NAME
       docker-container-logs - Fetch the logs of a container

SYNOPSIS
       docker container logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER

DESCRIPTION
       The docker container logs command batch-retrieves whatever logs are
       present for a container at the time of execution. This does not
       guarantee execution order when combined with a docker run (i.e., your
       run may not have generated any logs at the time you execute docker
       container logs).

       The docker container logs --follow command combines commands docker
       container logs and docker attach. It will first return all logs from
       the beginning and then continue streaming new output from the
       container's stdout and stderr.

       Warning: This command works only for the json-file or journald logging
       drivers.

       The --since and --until options can be Unix timestamps, date formatted
       timestamps, or Go duration strings (e.g. 10m, 1h30m) computed relative
       to the client machine's time. Supported formats for date formatted
       time stamps include RFC3339Nano, RFC3339, 2006-01-02T15:04:05,
       2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999, 2006-01-02Z07:00, and 2006-01-02. The
       local timezone on the client will be used if you do not provide either
       a Z or a +-00:00 timezone offset at the end of the timestamp.  When
       providing Unix timestamps enter seconds[.nanoseconds], where seconds
       is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970
       (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap  seconds (aka Unix epoch or Unix
       time), and the optional .nanoseconds field is a fraction of a second
       no more than nine digits long. You can combine the --since or --until
       options with either or both of the --follow or --tail options.

       The docker container logs --details command will add on extra
       attributes, such as environment variables and labels, provided to
       --log-opt when creating the container.

       In order to retrieve logs before a specific point in time, run:

              $ docker run --name test -d busybox sh -c "while true; do $(echo date); sleep 1; done"
              $ date
              Tue 14 Nov 2017 16:40:00 CET
              $ docker logs -f --until=2s
              Tue 14 Nov 2017 16:40:00 CET
              Tue 14 Nov 2017 16:40:01 CET
              Tue 14 Nov 2017 16:40:02 CET
