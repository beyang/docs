SLOCK(1)                                             BSD General Commands Manual                                            SLOCK(1)

NAME
     slock — simple X screen locker

SYNOPSIS
     slock [-v] [cmd [arg ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     slock is a simple X screen locker. If provided, cmd [arg ...] is executed after the screen has been locked.

OPTIONS
     -v      Print version information to stdout and exit.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     To make sure a locked screen can not be bypassed by switching VTs or killing the X server with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, it is recom‐
     mended to disable both in xorg.conf(5) for maximum security:

     Section "ServerFlags"
             Option "DontVTSwitch" "True"
             Option "DontZap"      "True"
     EndSection

EXAMPLES
     $ slock /usr/sbin/s2ram

CUSTOMIZATION
     slock can be customized by creating a custom config.h from config.def.h and (re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast,
     secure and simple.
