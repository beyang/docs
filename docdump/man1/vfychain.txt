NAME
       vfychain_ - vfychain [options] [revocation options] certfile [[options] certfile] ...

SYNOPSIS
       vfychain

STATUS
       This documentation is still work in progress. Please contribute to the initial review in Mozilla NSS bug 836477[1]

DESCRIPTION
       The verification Tool, vfychain, verifies certificate chains.  modutil can add and delete PKCS #11 modules, change passwords
       on security databases, set defaults, list module contents, enable or disable slots, enable or disable FIPS 140-2 compliance,
       and assign default providers for cryptographic operations. This tool can also create certificate, key, and module security
       database files.

       The tasks associated with security module database management are part of a process that typically also involves managing key
       databases and certificate databases.

OPTIONS
       -a
           the following certfile is base64 encoded

       -b  YYMMDDHHMMZ
           Validate date (default: now)

       -d  directory
           database directory

       -f
           Enable cert fetching from AIA URL

       -o  oid
           Set policy OID for cert validation(Format OID.1.2.3)

       -p
           Use PKIX Library to validate certificate by calling:

           * CERT_VerifyCertificate if specified once,

           * CERT_PKIXVerifyCert if specified twice and more.

       -r
           Following certfile is raw binary DER (default)

       -t
           Following cert is explicitly trusted (overrides db trust)

       -u  usage
           0=SSL client, 1=SSL server, 2=SSL StepUp, 3=SSL CA, 4=Email signer, 5=Email recipient, 6=Object signer,
           9=ProtectedObjectSigner, 10=OCSP responder, 11=Any CA

       -T
           Trust both explicit trust anchors (-t) and the database. (Without this option, the default is to only trust certificates
           marked -t, if there are any, or to trust the database if there are certificates marked -t.)

       -v
           Verbose mode. Prints root cert subject(double the argument for whole root cert info)

       -w  password
           Database password

       -W  pwfile
           Password file

           Revocation options for PKIX API (invoked with -pp options) is a collection of the following flags: [-g type [-h flags]
           [-m type [-s flags]] ...] ...

           Where:

       -g  test-type
           Sets status checking test type. Possible values are "leaf" or "chain"

       -g  test type
           Sets status checking test type. Possible values are "leaf" or "chain".

       -h  test flags
           Sets revocation flags for the test type it follows. Possible flags: "testLocalInfoFirst" and "requireFreshInfo".

       -m  method type
           Sets method type for the test type it follows. Possible types are "crl" and "ocsp".

       -s  method flags
           Sets revocation flags for the method it follows. Possible types are "doNotUse", "forbidFetching", "ignoreDefaultSrc",
           "requireInfo" and "failIfNoInfo".
