NAME
       docker-image-rm - Remove one or more images

SYNOPSIS
       docker image rm [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]

DESCRIPTION
       Removes (and un-tags) one or more images from the host node. If an
       image has multiple tags, using this command with the tag as a
       parameter only removes the tag. If the tag is the only one for the
       image, both the image and the tag are removed.

       This does not remove images from a registry. You cannot remove an
       image of a running container unless you use the -f option. To see all
       images on a host use the docker image ls command.

EXAMPLES
Removing an image
       Here is an example of removing an image:

              docker image rm fedora/httpd

OPTIONS
       -f, --force[=false]
           Force removal of the image

       -h, --help[=false]
           help for rm

       --no-prune[=false]
           Do not delete untagged parents
