NAME
       docker-volume - Manage volumes

SYNOPSIS
       docker volume COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       The docker volume command has subcommands for managing data volumes. A
       data volume is a specially-designated directory that by-passes storage
       driver management.

       Data volumes persist data independent of a container's life cycle.
       When you delete a container, the Docker daemon does not delete any
       data volumes. You can share volumes across multiple containers.
       Moreover, you can share data volumes with other computing resources in
       your system.

       To see help for a subcommand, use:

              docker volume COMMAND --help

       For full details on using docker volume visit Docker's online
       documentation.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help[=false]
           help for volume
