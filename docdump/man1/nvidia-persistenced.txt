NAME
       nvidia-persistenced  -  A daemon to maintain persistent software state
       in the NVIDIA driver.

SYNOPSIS
       nvidia-persistenced

DESCRIPTION
       The nvidia-persistenced utility is used to enable persistent  software
       state  in  the  NVIDIA  driver.  When persistence mode is enabled, the
       daemon prevents the driver from releasing device state when the device
       is  not  in  use.  This can improve the startup time of new clients in
       this scenario.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Print the utility version and exit.

       -h, --help
              Print usage information for the command line options and exit.

       -V, --verbose
              Controls  how  much  information  is   printed.   By   default,
              nvidia-persistenced will only print errors and warnings to sys‐
              log for unexpected events, as  well  as  startup  and  shutdown
              notices. Specifying this flag will cause nvidia-persistenced to
              also print notices to syslog on state transitions, such as when
              persistence mode is enabled or disabled, and informational mes‐
              sages on startup and exit.

       -u USERNAME, --user=USERNAME
              Runs nvidia-persistenced with the user permissions of the  user
              specified  by  the USERNAME argument. This user must have write
              access to the /var/run/nvidia-persistenced directory.  If  this
              directory  does  not exist, nvidia-persistenced will attempt to
              create it prior to changing the process user and group IDs.  If
              this  option is not given, nvidia-persistenced will not attempt
              to change the process user ID.

       -g GROUPNAME, --group=GROUPNAME
              Runs nvidia-persistenced with  the  group  permissions  of  the
              group  specified by the GROUPNAME argument. If both this option
              and the --user option are given, this option will  take  prece‐
              dence  when  determining the group ID to use. If this option is
              not given, nvidia-persistenced will use the primary group ID of
              the user specified by the --user option argument. If the --user
              option is also not given, nvidia-persistenced will not  attempt
              to change the process group ID.

       --persistence-mode, --no-persistence-mode
              By  default,  nvidia-persistenced  starts with persistence mode
              enabled for all devices. Use '--no-persistence-mode'  to  force
              persistence mode off for all devices on startup.

       --nvidia-cfg-path=PATH
              The  nvidia-cfg  library is used to communicate with the NVIDIA
              kernel module to query and manage  GPUs  in  the  system.  This
              library  is  required by nvidia-persistenced. This option tells
              nvidia-persistenced where to look for this library (in case  it
              cannot  find it on its own). This option should normally not be
              needed.

INSTALLATION
       When installed by nvidia-installer , sample init scripts to start  the
       daemon  for  some  of the more prevalent init systems are installed as
       the  compressed  tarball  /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/sample/nvidia-
       persistenced-init.tar.bz2.  These init scripts should be customized to
       the user's distribution and installed in the proper  location  by  the
       user to run nvidia-persistenced on system initialization.

       Once the init script is installed so that the daemon is running, users
       should not normally need  to  manually  interact  with  nvidia-persis‐
       tenced:  the NVIDIA management utilities, such as nvidia-smi, can com‐
       municate with it automatically  as  necessary  to  manage  persistence
       mode.

       See  the "Using the nvidia-persistenced Utility" section of the NVIDIA
       Linux Graphics Driver README for more  background,  information  about
       installing  the  nvidia-persistenced utility to run on system initial‐
       ization, and troubleshooting tips.

PRIVILEGES
       The daemon does not require root privileges to run, and may safely  be
       run  as  an  unprivileged  user,  given  that  its  runtime directory,
       /var/run/nvidia-persistenced, is created for and owned  by  that  user
       prior  to starting the daemon.  nvidia-persistenced also requires read
       and write access to the NVIDIA character device files.  If the permis‐
       sions  of  the  device  files  have  been  altered  through any of the
       NVreg_DeviceFileUID,  NVreg_DeviceFile_GID,  or   NVreg_DeviceFileMode
       NVIDIA  kernel module options, nvidia-persistenced will need to run as
       a suitable user.

       If the daemon is started with root privileges, the --user  option  may
       be used instead to indicate that the daemon should drop its privileges
       and run as the specified user after setting up its runtime  directory.
       Using  this  option  may  cause  the daemon to be unable to remove the
       /var/run/nvidia-persistenced directory when it is killed, if the spec‐
       ified user does not have write permissions to /var/run.  In this case,
       directory removal should be handled by a post-execution  script.   See
       the sample init scripts provided in /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/sam‐
       ple/nvidia-persistenced-init.tar.bz2 for examples of this behavior.

       The daemon indirectly  utilizes  nvidia-modprobe  via  the  nvidia-cfg
       library to load the NVIDIA kernel module and create the NVIDIA charac‐
       ter device files after the daemon has dropped its root privileges,  if
       it  had  any  to begin with.  If nvidia-modprobe is not installed, the
       daemon may not be able to start properly if it is not  run  with  root
       privileges.
