MANCONV(1)                    Manual pager utils                   MANCONV(1)

NAME
       manconv - convert manual page from one encoding to another

SYNOPSIS
       manconv -f from-code[:from-code...]  -t to-code [-dqhV] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       manconv  converts  a  manual  page  from one encoding to another, like
       iconv.  Unlike iconv, it can try multiple possible input encodings  in
       sequence.   This  is  useful for manual pages installed in directories
       without an explicit encoding declaration, since they may be  in  UTF-8
       or in a legacy character set.

       If  an  encoding  declaration is found on the first line of the manual
       page, that declaration overrides any input encodings specified on man‚Äê
       conv's command line.  Encoding declarations have the following form:

              '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

       or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):

              '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-

OPTIONS
       -f encodings, --from-code encodings
              Try  each  of encodings (a colon-separated list) in sequence as
              the input encoding.

       -t encoding, --to-code encoding
              Convert the manual page to encoding.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not issue error messages when the page cannot be converted.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.
